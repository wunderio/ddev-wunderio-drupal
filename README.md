# Wunder template for DDEV Drupal projects

This project extends the standard [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) setup with additional functionality and tools specifically
designed for Drupal development. It provides a set of custom commands, configurations, and automation
scripts to enhance your Drupal development workflow.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [DDEV >= 1.24.3](https://ddev.com/)

### Steps

1. Initialize your Drupal project. Project name parameter is optional, but
   it's advisable to use domain name as your project name as that's used for
   the subdomain of ddev.site eg if project name is example.com, then localhost
   URL will become example.com.ddev.site.

   ```bash
   ddev config --project-type=drupalN --docroot=web --project-name=example.com
   ```

   where N is the version of Drupal.

2. Install Wunderio DDEV Drupal as a DDEV add-on and restart DDEV:

   ```bash
   ddev add-on get wunderio/ddev-wunderio-drupal && ddev restart
   ```

3. Optionally if you have GrumPHP installed:

   - **Default setup (recommended):** In many setups the default `php` used by GrumPHP works out of the box and you **do not need any custom `EXEC_GRUMPHP_COMMAND`** in `grumphp.yml`.
   - **If you previously added a custom `EXEC_GRUMPHP_COMMAND` for DDEV/Lando:** You can safely remove the entire `git_hook_variables` section from `grumphp.yml` and then re‑initialise the hooks so they use the default configuration.

   After adjusting `grumphp.yml`, re‑init the hook:

   ```bash
   ddev grumphp git:init
   ```

4. Add changes to GIT (note that below command uses -p, so you need to say 'y'es or 'n'o if it asks what to commit):

   ```bash
   git add .ddev/ &&
   git add drush/sites/ &&
   git add -p web/sites/default/settings.php grumphp.yml &&
   git commit
   ```

   Also note that whenever you update wunderio/ddev-wunderio-drupal add-on, you need to add everything under .ddev to GIT.

### Updating the add-on

- To update the add-on to the latest version:

  ```bash
  ddev add-on get wunderio/ddev-wunderio-drupal
  ```

## Features

For a quick reference in your project's README, add:

```markdown
This project uses [ddev-wunderio-drupal](https://github.com/wunderio/ddev-wunderio-drupal) DDEV add-on. Run `ddev -h` to see all available commands.
```

### Custom DDEV Commands

- `pmu`: Runs drush pmu commands and creates dummy module folders if they don't exist.
  This helps to uninstall module that has gone missing for example during branch
  switching.

  ```bash
  ddev pmu module1 module2 ...
  ```

- `twig-debug`: Toggles Drupal Twig debugging on/off. Useful for template development.

  ```bash
  ddev twig-debug        # Enable Twig debugging
  ddev twig-debug off    # Disable Twig debugging
  ```

- `grumphp`: Runs GrumPHP commands.

  ```bash
  ddev grumphp
  ```

- `phpunit`: Runs PHPUnit commands.

  ```bash
  ddev phpunit
  ```

- `regenerate-phpunit-config`: Regenerates fresh PHPUnit configuration. Run this if you don't have phpunit configured in your project.

  ```bash
  ddev regenerate-phpunit-config
  ```

- `codecept`: Runs codeception commands.

  ```bash
  ddev codecept
  ```

- `phpcbf`: Runs PHPCBF commands.

  ```bash
  ddev phpcbf
  ```

- `phpcs`: Runs PHPCS commands.

  ```bash
  ddev phpcs
  ```

- `phpstan`: Runs PHPStan commands. Usually, the directory to be scanned is web/modules/custom or a module in the said directory.

  ```bash
  ddev phpstan analyze <directory-or-module-to-be-scanned>
  ```

- `syncdb`: Synchronizes local database from a remote environment.
  Requires aliases in `drush/sites/self.site.yml`.

  ```bash
  ddev syncdb <alias>                # e.g. ddev syncdb prod
  ddev syncdb prod --backup          # Back up local DB before overwriting
  ddev syncdb prod --skip-hooks       # Skip ddev hooks
  ddev syncdb prod --keep-dump        # Keep the downloaded dump file
  ddev syncdb prod --backup --skip-hooks   # Combine flags
  ```

- `yq`: Runs [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) commands (YAML processor).
  It's available inside DDEV, but we expose it to host because why not :). It's required in syncdb script, but it could prove useful in day to day work.

  ```bash
  ddev yq
  ```

- `commit`: Generates AI-powered commit messages from staged changes using the configured API.
  The command analyzes your staged changes and branch name to generate commit messages following
  the project's commit message format (ticket/issue ID prefix, present tense, imperative mood).
  Requires `OPENAI_API_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables to be configured via DDEV global config.

  ```bash
  ddev commit
  ```

  **Setup:** Configure the API credentials in DDEV global config (applies to all projects) and restart your DDEV project:

  ```bash
  ddev config global --web-environment-add="OPENAI_API_URL=https://your-api-url"
  ddev config global --web-environment-add="OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key"
  ddev restart
  ```

  **Note:** The global config is stored in `~/.ddev/global_config.yaml`. You can edit this file directly if you prefer, then restart your DDEV project.

### Enhanced Configuration

1. **Custom DDEV Configuration**
   - Post-start scripts for both host and web containers — by default it gives you a uli link.
   - Automatic update checks for this package.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Special `database_dumps/` directory for Mac users not to mount db dumps.

### Automated Workflows

The project includes several automated workflows:

1. **Database Management**
   - Post-import and post-restore-snapshot hooks (sanitize database).
   - Database synchronization from remote environments via `ddev syncdb`.
   - Run `ddev drush deploy` after import to apply updates, import config, and rebuild caches.

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Automatic Composer installation on first start.
   - Post-start hook that runs `drush uli`.
   - Integration with Wunderio's development tools, e.g. GrumPHP, PHPUnit.

Both custom commands and hooks are scripts under `~/.ddev/wunderio/core/` folder
(note it's your host home folder) and you can extend them if you copy particular
script to your project `.ddev/wunderio/custom/` folder. This folder is never
overwritten during autoupdate.

### Migration from Composer plugin (legacy)

Previously, this package was installed as a Composer plugin and deployed files into the project. To migrate:

1. Remove legacy managed files from previous versions if present and commit your cleanup.
2. Install the add-on via `ddev add-on get wunderio/ddev-wunderio-drupal`.
3. Verify `.ddev/wunderio/custom/` overrides are preserved.
4. Commit updated `.ddev/` files.

5. Import database:

   ```bash
   ddev import-db --file=some-sql-or-sql.gz.file.sql.gz
   ```

   or install site:

   ```bash
   ddev drush si
   ```

6. Create admin link and login:

   ```bash
   ddev drush uli
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Dumps Directory (macOS)

Store database dump files in the `database_dumps/` directory at the project root. On macOS this directory is excluded from Mutagen sync, avoiding slow DDEV startups and disk bloat.

Configured via `upload_dirs` in `.ddev/config.wunderio.yaml`:

```yaml
upload_dirs:
  - ../database_dumps
```

`ddev syncdb` uses this directory automatically. For manual imports:

```bash
ddev import-db --file=database_dumps/my-database-backup.sql.gz
```

**Note:** On Linux (no Mutagen) this has no performance effect, but keeps dumps organized consistently across teams.
